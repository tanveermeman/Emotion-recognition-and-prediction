 Emotion-recognition-and-prediction

A real time system to detect human emotions from image and predict its 
reaction. This is a pre-trained model with an accuracy of **68.7%** over
 FER 2013 dataset. this project was completed as a part of my final year
 project for B.E. in information technology from pune university. 

# Prerequisites
```
Python 3
OpenCV
```
# Installation
```
pip install tensorflow numpy scipy h5py
```
Download the trained model from the links given in 
source/trained-model.txt
# Testing
```
python em_model.py
```
# Run the project
```
python em_model.py.
-> A prompt will be given to the user to enter the duration for how 
long the application is supposed to run.
-> The appplication will run for the given time and display real time
 feedback of the subjects emtions on the screen.
-> As well as the application will also give a well defined graphical
 representation of the subjects emotions through the
period he/she was monitored.
